# Gauntlet: Dark Legacy

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they
would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Items
13 Runestones
8 Shards
9 Legendary Weapons (incl. Soul Savior)
3 Wing Keys (East + West+Lower Tower)
Optionally, 8 Region Keys (incl. Battlefield, not including starting region)

Locations
All 13 Runestone Locations
All 10 of the realm bosses (Shards + Skorne 1 & Skorne 2)
All 9 of the Legendary Weapon locations
All 8 of the Treasure Rooms
All 8 vanilla realm unlocks

## What is the goal of Gauntlet: Dark Legacy?

Same as vanilla, beat Garm
